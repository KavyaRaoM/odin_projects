        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger_Garlic paste</li>

        <li>coriander powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If using fresh paneer, you can soak it in warm water for 15-20 minutes to keep it soft. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.
        </li>
        <li>Add Kashmiri red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook the spices for 1-2 minutes until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato puree and mix thoroughly. Cook the mixture on medium heat until the oil starts to separate from the gravy, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and add the remaining butter. Stir in sugar (if using) and adjust salt to taste. Simmer the gravy for 8-10 minutes until it thickens and the flavors meld together.
        </li>
        <li>Gently add the cubed paneer to the gravy and mix well, ensuring the paneer is coated evenly with the sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to heat the paneer through.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and stir gently to incorporate it into the gravy. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, being careful not to let the cream boil excessively.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish Paneer Butter Masala with chopped fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.
