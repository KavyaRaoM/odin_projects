        <li>Star Anise</li>
        <li>Cardamom</li>
        <li>Cinnamom</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>Cloves</li>
        <li>Ginger-Garlic paste</li>

        <li>Fried Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves, and salt. Marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pan and fry the sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove and set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil, add salt, cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick. Add the soaked rice and cook until itâ€™s 70% done (rice should still be firm). Drain the rice and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In the same pan used for frying onions, add the marinated chicken along with the marinade. Cook on medium heat until the chicken is tender and the oil starts to separate from the masala.
        </li>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani pot, spread a layer of the partially cooked rice at the bottom. Add a layer of the cooked chicken with its masala. Sprinkle some of the fried onions, chopped mint, and coriander leaves on top. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of rice.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the saffron-soaked milk over the top layer of rice. This gives the biryani a rich aroma and color.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If the lid isn't tight enough, seal it with dough to ensure no steam escapes.</li>
        <li>Place the sealed pot on a low flame or on a tawa (flat griddle) to distribute the heat evenly. Cook for 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. This is called cooking on 'dum.'</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes without opening the lid. This helps in further enhancing the flavors.</li>
        <li>Gently fluff up the biryani with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) and enjoy your delicious Hyderabadi chicken biryani!</li>
