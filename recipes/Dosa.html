    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Split Black gram</li>
        <li>Fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice and urad dal separately under running water. Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds in one bowl and the urad dal in another bowl for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice and dal. In a blender, grind the urad dal first with some water until it becomes a smooth and fluffy batter. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, grind the rice and fenugreek seeds with water to make a smooth batter. Combine this with the urad dal batter in the large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the batters together well and add salt. Cover the bowl and let it sit in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight to ferment. The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with a few drops of oil or ghee and spread it with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Stir the fermented batter gently. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin dosa.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>If you prefer a crispy dosa, you can flip it and cook the other side for a minute. Otherwise, you can serve it directly without flipping.</li>
        <li>Remove the dosa from the pan and serve hot with chutney, sambar, or potato masala.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan lightly before making each dosa.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your crispy and delicious dosas!</li>
